### Arduino Syntaxed I2C Bit Banging
---
Most libraries are designed for effieciency, which is great, but not always easy to understand if you're trying to learn. Given Arduino is a major access point, it seemed appropriate to write an example with Arduino sytnax.

It's a rushed example, so expect mistakes - hopefully, it provides some educational value. 

Was written on the ESP32, but moved the UNO for the purpose of this library.
